### What is this?

A git repo that is the host for an node module.
‌‍
## What's ‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‍‌‍i‌‍t do?

Puts some hidden chars into your clipboard, b‌‍ut that's not important right now.

Wait.‌‍

Yes it is. Ok, so you know that hidden chars are th‌‍e worst right? Well, sometimes you want to use them with‌‍out typing /uWHATEVER. Now you can just in‌‍‌‍voke this dumb package after installing it globally `npm i -g clipboard-hidden` or `yarn‌‍ add --dev clipboard-hidden`, and now you too will have hidden chara‌‍cters easily p‌‍‌‍‌‍aste-able into whatever location you'd like ‌‍to **fuck up re‌‍al bad**. Honestly I'm just lazy, and I lik‌‍e to make packages that do command line things that I can't remember.

Also, there's like a bazillion hidden chars on this readme.

### USE EXAMPLE:

In the terminal:

```
clipboard-hidden
```

Then, paste some chars in the console, after the a: in the object. :point_down: *or copy that command*
```
const a = JSON.parse('{ a‌‍‌‍: "some hidden strings"}');
```
`a.a should = undefined`
